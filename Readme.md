# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Overview

## [What is a PWA?](./pwa.md)

A **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** is a type of web app designed to work seamlessly across both web and mobile environments. PWAs provide a native-like user experience with enhanced speed, offline capabilities, and multi-platform access. They leverage standard web technologies to deliver a smooth browsing experience even under poor network conditions.

### Key Benefits of PWAs:
- **All-in-One Solution**: Combines web and mobile app functionalities.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces development costs by avoiding separate native apps.
- **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost**: Users can install PWAs directly from a browser.
- **Headless Commerce Advantage**: Enables flexible frontend and backend integration.
- **Improved SEO**: Easily indexed by search engines.
- **Reduced Bounce Rate**: Fast loading and offline support enhance user engagement.
- **Increased Engagement and Conversions**: Push notifications and full-screen capabilities.

## How PWAs Differ from Native Mobile Apps

| Aspect                | PWA                                            | Native Mobile App                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Technology Stack**  | Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)      | Platform-specific languages and frameworks |
| **Accessibility**     | Accessible via URLs, no app store needed      | Requires download from app stores          |
| **Deployment**        | Instant deployment and automatic updates      | Requires app store submission and approval |
| **Development Time**  | Shorter development cycles for cross-platform | Separate development for iOS and Android   |

## Software Architecture

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: Single unit application including frontend, backend, and database.
- **Example**: Early-stage startups or small businesses.

### Microservices Architecture
- **Description**: Application divided into independent services communicating via APIs.
- **Example**: Netflix’s PWA with services for user authentication and content delivery.

### Serverless Architecture
- **Description**: Outsources server management to a cloud provider, using event-driven functions.
- **Example**: BBC’s PWA for real-time data updates.

### Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture
- **Description**: Loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content.
- **Example**: Twitter Lite PWA.

### Multi-Page Application (MPA) Architecture
- **Description**: Traditional web app with separate HTML pages for different sections.
- **Example**: Flipkart’s PWA.
